READER for rpc-literal examples
=============================== 2008-12-26

These examples are rewrites from an RPC-Literal detailed description
kindly provided by Daniel Ruoso.  They are also used in a test-script
to guarantee that they will continue to work in future releases.

One pair of files show how rpc-literal via 'element' works, and
one how rpc-literal via 'type' is working.  Exactly the same for
the end-user's point of view, while the messages do slightly differ.
