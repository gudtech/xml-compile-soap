=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension - plugins for standards

=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension is extended by
   XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA
   XML::Compile::Transport

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines hooks which are used to implement the SOAP and
WSDL extensions. Hooks are created on critial spots, where additional
standards play tricks with the logic of SOAP and WSDL. There are a
lot of those standards, for instance Web Service Addressing (WSA,
L<XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA|XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA>)
